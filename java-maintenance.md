## Completed Items
- [x] Initial build verification (./mvnw clean verify)
- [x] Dependency analysis completed - no updates needed per constraints
- [x] Updated LocaleUtils to properly handle locale variants using Locale.Builder
  - Fixed variant validation to comply with Java's Locale.Builder requirements
  - Updated test cases with valid variant strings (5-8 alphanumeric characters)
  - All tests passing with proper validation in place
- [x] Reviewed base package tests
  - PreconditionsTest has good coverage with @Nested, @DisplayName, and @ParameterizedTest
  - BooleanOperationsTest uses @CsvSource effectively for test cases
  - Both test classes handle edge cases and error conditions well
- [x] Enhanced array formatting in MoreStrings.lenientToString
  ### Changes Made
  - Enhanced `MoreStrings.lenientToString()` to use `Arrays.toString()` for proper array formatting
  - Updated tests in `PreconditionsTest` to verify the new array formatting behavior
  - Arrays are now displayed with their actual contents (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) instead of identity hash codes

  ### Impact
  - Improved readability of error messages when arrays are involved
  - More intuitive string representation of arrays in debug and error scenarios
  - No breaking changes to existing functionality

  ### Files Changed
  - `src/main/java/de/cuioss/tools/string/MoreStrings.java`
  - `src/test/java/de/cuioss/tools/base/PreconditionsTest.java`
- [x] 2025-01-31 Enhanced BooleanOperationsTest Structure and Coverage

  ### Changes Made
  - Reorganized test structure using `@Nested` classes for better organization
  - Added comprehensive test cases using `@ParameterizedTest` and `@CsvSource`
  - Improved test names and documentation with `@DisplayName`
  - Added performance tests for large arrays and worst-case scenarios
  - Implemented concurrent access testing
  - Enhanced edge case coverage including null handling

  ### Impact
  - Better test organization and readability
  - More comprehensive test coverage
  - Verified performance characteristics
  - Validated thread safety of boolean operations

  ### Files Changed
  - `src/test/java/de/cuioss/tools/base/BooleanOperationsTest.java`

## Current Package Progress (de.cuioss.tools.base)
### Test Refactoring
- [x] Review existing tests
  - Preconditions.java: Well tested with good error message coverage
  - BooleanOperations.java: Good coverage of core operations
- [x] Add performance tests for large boolean arrays
- [x] Test concurrent usage scenarios
- [x] Add complex message formatting tests
- [ ] Document test coverage metrics

## Important Notes
- Following strict dependency management constraints:
  * Must work with existing dependencies
  * No new dependencies allowed
  * CUI dependencies only if present
- Initial build successful with all 648 tests passing
- No immediate build issues identified
- Test framework already using JUnit 5 effectively

## Next Steps
1. Implement additional test cases for base package
2. Move to code refactoring phase
3. Update documentation
4. Proceed to next package (codec)
