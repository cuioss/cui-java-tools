## Completed Items
- [x] Initial build verification (./mvnw clean verify)
- [x] Dependency analysis completed - no updates needed per constraints
- [x] Updated LocaleUtils to properly handle locale variants using Locale.Builder
  - Fixed variant validation to comply with Java's Locale.Builder requirements
  - Updated test cases with valid variant strings (5-8 alphanumeric characters)
  - All tests passing with proper validation in place
- [x] Reviewed base package tests
  - PreconditionsTest has good coverage with @Nested, @DisplayName, and @ParameterizedTest

## Current Package Progress (de.cuioss.tools.base)
### Test Refactoring
- [x] Review existing tests

## Important Notes
- Following strict dependency management constraints:
  * Must work with existing dependencies
  * No new dependencies allowed
  * CUI dependencies only if present
- Initial build successful with all 648 tests passing
- No immediate build issues identified
- Test framework already using JUnit 5 effectively

## Next Steps
1. Implement additional test cases for base package
2. Move to code refactoring phase
3. Update documentation
4. Proceed to next package (codec)
