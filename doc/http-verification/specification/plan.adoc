[IMPORTANT]
====
This document defines WHAT tasks need to be implemented for the URL Security Validation system.
For HOW the system architecture works, see link:specification.adoc[Architecture Specification].
For HOW to test the system, see link:testing.adoc[Testing Framework].
====

== Purpose

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step tasks required to build a comprehensive URL security validation system that prevents path traversal attacks, encoding bypasses, and other URL-based security vulnerabilities in the `de.cuioss.tools.security.http` package.

**/cl**

**Reference**: link:../../ai-rules.md#task-completion-standards-mandatory[AI Rules: Task Completion Standards]

**ALWAYS ONE TASK AT A TIME**: Follow this exact sequence for EVERY task:

1. **Implement** → Write the code/feature for ONE specific task
2. **Test** → Create and run tests to verify the implementation works
3. **Verify** → Run quality checks: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify`
   - Fix ALL errors and warnings (mandatory)
   - Address code quality, formatting, and linting issues
   - Never commit markers - fix or suppress with justification
4. **Document Status/Progress** → Update implementation status in this plan
5. **Commit** → Create focused commit with proper message

**DO NOT:**

- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- Skip the verification step
- Commit without running pre-commit checks
- Leave quality issues unresolved

**This workflow ensures high quality, prevents technical debt, and maintains project standards.**
====

== Task Organization

Tasks are categorized with specific prefixes for tracking:

* *G* - Test Generators and Test Infrastructure

* *P* - Pipeline Implementation
* *T* - Concrete Security Test Cases
* *I* - Integration and Documentation

== Dependencies and Critical Path

=== Task Dependencies

* Phase 1 (Generators) - No dependencies, can start immediately
* Phase 2 (Base Structure) - Depends on G1-G10 for testing
* Phase 3 (Configuration) - Depends on B1-B3 for types
* Phase 4 (Security Tracking) - Depends on B1-B2 for event types
* Phase 5 (Validation Stages) - Depends on B1-B3, C1-C3, S1-S2
* Phase 6 (Pipelines) - Depends on V1-V5
* Phase 7 (Integration) - Depends on all previous phases

=== Critical Path

1. G1-G10 (Test Generators)
2. B1-B3 (Base Structure)
3. V1-V5 (Validation Stages)
4. P1-P5 (Pipelines)
5. T1-T36 (Security Tests)
6. I1-I5 (Integration)

== Quality Gates

Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:

* **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% line coverage
* **Security Testing**: All attack vectors properly blocked
* **Performance**: Validation overhead <1ms per request
* **Documentation**: All public APIs with complete Javadoc
* **Integration**: Compatibility with cui-java-tools patterns

== Success Metrics

* ✅ All 103 tasks completed
* ✅ Zero false negatives for known attacks
* ✅ <0.1% false positive rate
* ✅ <1ms performance for 95% of validations
* ✅ 100% OWASP Top 10 compliance
* ✅ All CVE patterns from 2020-2024 blocked

== Implementation Guidelines

[IMPORTANT]
====
**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Every task must follow the **Task Completion Standards** workflow:

1. **Implement** → Write code for ONE task only
2. **Test** → Create and verify tests work  
3. **Verify** → Run `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` and fix ALL issues
4. **Document Progress** → Update status in this plan
5. **Commit** → Single focused commit with proper message

**Reference**: link:../../ai-rules.md#task-completion-standards-mandatory[AI Rules: Task Completion Standards]
====

Each task should be implemented following the architecture specified in link:specification.adoc[Architecture Specification] and tested according to link:testing.adoc[Testing Framework].

The tasks are designed to build incrementally, with each phase depending on the components from previous phases.

=== Quality Standards

- **Pre-commit verification is MANDATORY** - never skip this step
- **One task at a time** - avoid working on multiple tasks simultaneously  
- **Complete documentation** - update progress and maintain traceability
- **Test coverage** - ensure all new code is properly tested
- **Code quality** - address all warnings and formatting issues

=== Task Status Tracking

Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in the Status column after successful completion of all 5 workflow steps.
