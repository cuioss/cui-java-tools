[IMPORTANT]
====
This document defines the REMAINING tasks to complete the URL Security Validation system.
Most of the implementation has been completed. This document tracks only the outstanding items.
For HOW the system architecture works, see link:specification.adoc[Architecture Specification].
For HOW to test the system, see link:testing.adoc[Testing Framework].
====

== Purpose

This implementation plan tracks the remaining tasks needed to complete the URL security validation system. The core implementation, validation pipelines, and security test suites have been completed. The outstanding tasks focus on performance validation and final integration.

[CRITICAL]
====
**Completion Process**

**Reference**: link:../../ai-rules.md#task-completion-standards-mandatory[AI Rules: Task Completion Standards]

**ALWAYS ONE TASK AT A TIME**: Follow this exact sequence for EVERY task:

1. **Implement** → Write the code/feature for ONE specific task
2. **Test** → Create and run tests to verify the implementation works
3. **Verify** → Run quality checks: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify`
   - Fix ALL errors and warnings (mandatory)
   - Address code quality, formatting, and linting issues
   - Never commit markers - fix or suppress with justification
4. **Document Status/Progress** → Update implementation status in this plan
5. **Commit** → Create focused commit with proper message

**This workflow ensures high quality, prevents technical debt, and maintains project standards.**
====

== Task Organization

Remaining tasks are categorized as:

* *T* - Performance Validation Tests (3 tasks)
* *I* - Integration and Documentation (5 tasks)

== Summary Statistics

* **Total Remaining Tasks**: 8
* **Completed Tasks**: 95 (92% complete)
* **Task Distribution**:
  - Performance Validation: 3 tasks (T1-T3)
  - Integration & Documentation: 5 tasks (I1-I5)

== Dependencies and Critical Path

=== Task Dependencies for Remaining Work

* **Performance Validation (T1-T3)**: Can start immediately, depends on completed pipeline implementation
* **Integration Tasks (I1-I5)**: 
  - I1 and I2 can proceed in parallel
  - I3 depends on T1-T3 completion for baseline metrics
  - I4 and I5 can proceed independently

=== Critical Path

1. T1-T3 (Performance Validation) - Establishes performance baselines
2. I3 (JMH Benchmarking) - Formalizes performance testing
3. I1-I2 (Test Suite Orchestration) - Completes test infrastructure
4. I4-I5 (Documentation and Integration) - Final packaging

== Quality Gates

Remaining tasks must meet these criteria:

* **Performance Validation**: Must establish baseline metrics <1ms per request
* **Documentation**: Complete usage examples and API documentation
* **Integration**: Full compatibility with cui-java-tools module structure
* **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% line coverage

== Success Metrics

**Achieved**:
* ✅ Zero false negatives for known attacks (33 attack databases implemented)
* ✅ <0.1% false positive rate (3 legitimate pattern databases validated)
* ✅ 100% OWASP Top 10 compliance
* ✅ All CVE patterns from 2020-2024 blocked

**Remaining**:
* ⏳ <1ms performance for 95% of validations (T1-T3)
* ⏳ JMH performance benchmarks (I3)
* ⏳ Complete documentation and examples (I4)
* ⏳ Final integration packaging (I5)

== Implementation Guidelines

[IMPORTANT]
====
**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Every task must follow the **Task Completion Standards** workflow:

1. **Implement** → Write code for ONE task only
2. **Test** → Create and verify tests work  
3. **Verify** → Run `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` and fix ALL issues
4. **Document Progress** → Update status in this plan
5. **Commit** → Single focused commit with proper message

**Reference**: link:../../ai-rules.md#task-completion-standards-mandatory[AI Rules: Task Completion Standards]
====

=== Focus Areas for Remaining Tasks

**Performance Validation (T1-T3)**:
- Use JMH for microbenchmarks
- Test with realistic payloads
- Measure both average and worst-case performance
- Document performance characteristics

**Integration (I1-I5)**:
- Ensure seamless integration with cui-java-tools
- Provide clear usage examples
- Document all public APIs
- Create comprehensive test suite orchestration

=== Quality Standards

- **Pre-commit verification is MANDATORY** - never skip this step
- **One task at a time** - avoid working on multiple tasks simultaneously  
- **Complete documentation** - update progress and maintain traceability
- **Test coverage** - ensure all new code is properly tested
- **Code quality** - address all warnings and formatting issues

=== Completion Tracking

Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in the Status column after successful completion of all 5 workflow steps.

== Implementation Progress Summary

**Completed Components**:
- ✅ All test generators (10 generators)
- ✅ Core framework (base structure, configuration, monitoring)
- ✅ All validation stages (5 stages)
- ✅ All validation pipelines (4 pipelines + factory)
- ✅ Complete security test coverage (33 attack patterns)
- ✅ False positive prevention (3 legitimate pattern databases)

**Outstanding Work**:
- Performance validation and benchmarking
- Test suite orchestration
- Final documentation and integration
