== Overview

This document serves as the main index for all requirements related to the HTTP Security Validation system. The requirements are organized into functional and security categories, with full traceability to specifications and implementation.

== Purpose

The HTTP Security Validation system provides comprehensive validation and sanitization of HTTP input components to prevent security vulnerabilities, particularly path traversal attacks. This requirements documentation ensures:

* Complete coverage of security concerns identified in OWASP Top 10
* Prevention of vulnerabilities found in CVE analysis
* Clear traceability from requirements to implementation
* Testable and measurable security objectives

== Requirements Organization

=== link:functional-requirements.adoc[Functional Requirements]

Defines the core functionality that the system must provide:

* **General Requirements** (HTTP-1 to HTTP-3): System-wide functional capabilities
* **Validation Pipeline** (HTTP-4 to HTTP-6): Validation architecture and processing
* **Path Traversal Prevention** (HTTP-7 to HTTP-9): Path security functionality
* **Character and Encoding** (HTTP-10 to HTTP-12): Input character handling
* **Configuration** (HTTP-13 to HTTP-14): System configuration capabilities
* **Error Handling** (HTTP-15 to HTTP-16): Exception and error management
* **Integration** (HTTP-17 to HTTP-18): Framework and system integration
* **Performance** (HTTP-19 to HTTP-20): Performance and resource management

=== link:security-requirements.adoc[Security Requirements]

Defines the security-specific requirements and controls:

* **OWASP Compliance** (SEC-1 to SEC-3): OWASP Top 10 prevention
* **Path Security** (SEC-4 to SEC-6): Path traversal and directory security
* **Input Validation** (SEC-7 to SEC-9): Security validation requirements
* **DoS Prevention** (SEC-10 to SEC-11): Denial of service protection
* **Monitoring** (SEC-12 to SEC-13): Security event tracking and alerting
* **Cryptographic** (SEC-14 to SEC-15): Encoding and cryptographic security
* **Audit** (SEC-16 to SEC-17): Audit trail and compliance
* **Integration Security** (SEC-18 to SEC-19): Secure integration requirements
* **Updates** (SEC-20 to SEC-21): Security update and threat management

== Requirement Prefixes

The following prefixes are used to categorize requirements:

* **HTTP-**: Functional requirements for HTTP security validation (HTTP-1 through HTTP-20)
  ** Sequential numbering for all functional requirements
  ** Covers general, validation, path security, character handling, configuration, error handling, integration, and performance requirements

* **SEC-**: Security-specific requirements (SEC-1 through SEC-21)
  ** Sequential numbering for all security requirements
  ** Covers OWASP compliance, path security, input validation, DoS prevention, monitoring, cryptographic, audit, integration security, and update management

== Traceability

All requirements maintain bidirectional traceability:

1. **Forward Traceability**: Each requirement links to its implementation specification
2. **Backward Traceability**: Specifications reference implementing requirements
3. **Test Traceability**: Requirements link to test specifications in link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing Framework]
4. **Security Traceability**: Security requirements trace to identified threats in link:analysis/cve-analysis.adoc[CVE Analysis]
