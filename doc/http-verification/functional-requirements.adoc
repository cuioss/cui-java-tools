== Overview

This document defines the functional requirements for the HTTP Security Validation system. The system provides comprehensive validation and sanitization of HTTP input components (URLs, paths, parameters, headers) to prevent security vulnerabilities, with a primary focus on path traversal attacks.

These requirements are derived from:

* link:specification/specification.adoc[Architecture Specification]
* link:analysis/owasp-best-practices.adoc[OWASP Best Practices Analysis]
* link:analysis/cve-analysis.adoc[CVE Analysis]

== General Requirements

=== [#HTTP-1]
=== HTTP-1: Multi-Component Validation Support

* The system must support validation of different HTTP components
  ** URL paths (e.g., `/api/users/123`)
  ** Query parameters (e.g., `?search=term&page=1`)
  ** HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer token`)
  ** Request body parameters (form-data, JSON, XML)
* Each component type must have appropriate validation rules
* The system must provide separate validators for each component type
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_validation_types[Validation Types]

=== [#HTTP-2]
=== HTTP-2: Zero External Dependencies

* The system must not require any external runtime dependencies
* All functionality must be self-contained within the library
* Development-only dependencies (e.g., Lombok) are permitted
* The system must be compatible with Jakarta EE environments

=== [#HTTP-3]
=== HTTP-3: Fail-Fast Security Model

* The system must immediately reject invalid input upon detection
* Security violations must throw runtime exceptions
* Validation must not continue after a security violation is detected
* All security failures must be logged appropriately
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_functionalinterface[Functional Interface Design]

== Validation Pipeline Requirements

=== [#HTTP-4]
=== HTTP-4: Sequential Validation Pipeline

* The system must execute validation stages in a defined sequence
* Each stage must complete successfully before the next stage executes
* The pipeline must support configurable stages based on validation type
* Pipeline execution must be atomic (all-or-nothing)
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_sequential_execution_model[Sequential Execution Model]

=== [#HTTP-5]
=== HTTP-5: Stage-Based Validation Architecture

* Each validation concern must be implemented as a separate stage
* Stages must implement a common interface (`HttpSecurityValidator`)
* Stages must be composable and reusable
* The system must support the following core stages:
  ** Length validation
  ** Encoding validation
  ** Character validation
  ** Normalization
  ** Pattern matching
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_validation_stages[Validation Stages]

=== [#HTTP-6]
=== HTTP-6: Input Normalization

* The system must normalize input before pattern matching
* Normalization must include:
  ** URL decoding
  ** Path canonicalization
  ** Unicode normalization (NFC)
  ** Removal of redundant path separators
* The system must detect when normalization changes input significantly
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_normalizationstage[Normalization Stage]

== Path Traversal Prevention Requirements

=== [#HTTP-7]
=== HTTP-7: Directory Traversal Detection

* The system must detect and block directory traversal sequences
* Must detect patterns including but not limited to:
  ** `../` and `..\` sequences
  ** Encoded variants (`%2e%2e%2f`, `%252e%252e%252f`)
  ** Unicode variants
  ** Mixed encoding attempts
* Detection must occur after normalization
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_patternmatchingstage[Pattern Matching Stage]

=== [#HTTP-8]
=== HTTP-8: Root Directory Escape Prevention

* The system must prevent paths that escape the application root
* Must detect attempts to access parent directories beyond the root
* Must handle both absolute and relative path validation
* Must maintain security even with symbolic links present
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_normalizationstage[Path Normalization]

=== [#HTTP-9]
=== HTTP-9: Double Encoding Protection

* The system must detect and block double-encoded input
* Must check for multiple levels of encoding:
  ** URL encoding over URL encoding
  ** Mixed encoding schemes
  ** Partial encoding attempts
* Must validate after each decoding pass
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_decodingstage[Decoding Stage]

== Character and Encoding Requirements

=== [#HTTP-10]
=== HTTP-10: Character Set Validation

* The system must validate characters against configurable allowed sets
* Must support different character sets for different validation types:
  ** Path segments: alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore, period
  ** Query parameters: extended ASCII subset
  ** Headers: visible ASCII characters
* Must detect and block control characters
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_charactervalidationstage[Character Validation Stage]

=== [#HTTP-11]
=== HTTP-11: Null Byte Injection Prevention

* The system must detect and block null bytes (`\0`, `%00`)
* Detection must occur in both raw and encoded forms
* Must check after each decoding stage
* Must prevent null byte injection in all validated components
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_charactervalidationstage[Character Security Validation]

=== [#HTTP-12]
=== HTTP-12: Unicode Security Validation

* The system must handle Unicode security concerns:
  ** Homograph attacks
  ** Invisible characters
  ** Right-to-left override characters
  ** Zero-width characters
* Must normalize Unicode to NFC form
* Must detect when normalization changes the input
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_encodingvalidationstage[Unicode Normalization]

== Configuration Requirements

=== [#HTTP-13]
=== HTTP-13: Configurable Validation Rules

* The system must support configuration of validation parameters:
  ** Maximum length limits
  ** Maximum directory depth
  ** Allowed character sets
  ** Encoding strictness levels
* Configuration must be immutable after initialization
* Must provide sensible secure defaults
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_configuration_architecture[Configuration Architecture]

=== [#HTTP-14]
=== HTTP-14: Validation Type Configuration

* Each validation type must have its own configuration:
  ** `URL_PATH`: Strict path validation rules
  ** `QUERY_PARAMETER`: Parameter-specific rules
  ** `HTTP_HEADER`: Header validation rules
* Configurations must be independently configurable
* Must support configuration inheritance for common settings
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_validation_type_configurations[Validation Type Configurations]

== Error Handling Requirements

=== [#HTTP-15]
=== HTTP-15: Detailed Security Exceptions

* Security violations must throw `UrlSecurityException`
* Exceptions must include:
  ** Failure type classification
  ** Validation type context
  ** Original input (for logging)
  ** Sanitized input (if available)
  ** Detailed error message
* Exceptions must extend `RuntimeException`
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_urlsecurityexception[Exception Design]

=== [#HTTP-16]
=== HTTP-16: Security Event Tracking

* The system must track security events through `SecurityEventCounter`
* Must count events by:
  ** Failure type
  ** Validation type
  ** Time window
* Must support metrics extraction for monitoring
* Must be thread-safe
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_event_counter_pattern[Event Counter Pattern]

== Integration Requirements

=== [#HTTP-17]
=== HTTP-17: Logging Integration

* The system must integrate with standard logging frameworks
* Must use CuiLogger for internal logging
* Must support different log levels for different event types
* Must not log sensitive data in clear text
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_securityeventcounter[Security Event Logging]

== Performance Requirements

=== [#HTTP-18]
=== HTTP-18: Efficient Validation Processing

* Validation must complete within reasonable time limits:
  ** Simple paths: < 1ms
  ** Complex encoded input: < 10ms
  ** Large headers: < 5ms
* Must handle high-throughput scenarios
* Must not cause memory leaks
* Reference: link:specification/testing.adoc#_performance_benchmarking[Performance Benchmarks]

=== [#HTTP-19]
=== HTTP-19: Resource Constraints

* The system must enforce resource limits:
  ** Maximum input length (configurable)
  ** Maximum decoding iterations (prevent DoS)
  ** Maximum normalization passes
* Must fail fast when limits are exceeded
* Must prevent algorithmic complexity attacks
* Reference: link:specification/specification.adoc#_lengthvalidationstage[Length Validation]
