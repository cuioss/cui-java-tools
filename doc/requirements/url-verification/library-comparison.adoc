== Design Patterns Comparison

=== Successful Patterns

==== Command Pattern (ESAPI)
* Encapsulates validation logic
* Enables composition of validators
* Supports custom implementations

==== Strategy Pattern (Spring)
* Multiple validation strategies
* Runtime configuration
* Adaptable to different threats

==== Template Method (NIO-based)
* Consistent validation process
* Customizable steps
* Platform abstraction

=== Anti-Patterns Identified

==== Direct Concatenation
[source,java]
----
// ANTI-PATTERN - Found in vulnerable implementations
String path = baseDir + userInput;
----

==== Blacklist Filtering
[source,java]
----
// ANTI-PATTERN - Insufficient protection
if (path.contains("../")) {
    throw new SecurityException();
}
----

==== String Replacement
[source,java]
----
// ANTI-PATTERN - Can be bypassed
path = path.replace("../", "");
----

== Implementation Recommendations

=== Best Practices from Analysis

. **Use Canonical Path Resolution**
  * Always resolve to canonical form
  * Validate after resolution
  * Example from secure implementations:
+
[source,java]
----
File file = new File(baseDirectory, userInput);
String canonical = file.getCanonicalPath();
if (!canonical.startsWith(baseDirectory.getCanonicalPath())) {
    throw new SecurityException("Path traversal attempt");
}
----

. **Implement Defense in Depth**
  * Input validation (whitelist)
  * Path normalization
  * Containment validation
  * Access controls
  * Monitoring and logging

. **Handle Encoding Properly**
  * Decode all encoding formats
  * Normalize before validation
  * Consider double encoding

. **Use Modern Java NIO**
+
[source,java]
----
Path basePath = Paths.get("/safe/directory");
Path userPath = basePath.resolve(userInput).normalize();
if (!userPath.startsWith(basePath)) {
    throw new SecurityException();
}
----

== Lessons from Vulnerabilities

=== Common Failure Patterns

. **Incomplete Edge Case Handling**
  * Special input formats not considered
  * Platform-specific behaviors ignored
  * Encoding variations missed

. **Over-reliance on Single Controls**
  * No defense in depth
  * Single point of failure
  * Lack of complementary controls

. **Implementation Complexity**
  * Complex code increases error likelihood
  * Difficult to test all scenarios
  * Maintenance challenges

=== Key Takeaways

. **No Library is Immune**: Even security-focused libraries have vulnerabilities
. **Complexity Creates Risk**: Simpler, well-understood approaches often safer
. **Testing is Critical**: Must test with actual attack patterns
. **Regular Updates Essential**: Libraries continuously patch vulnerabilities
. **Context Matters**: HTTP/URL validation requires specialized approaches
