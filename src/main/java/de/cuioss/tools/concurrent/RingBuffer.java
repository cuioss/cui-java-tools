/**
 * High-performance lock-free ring buffer implementation.
 * <p>
 * This class implements a fixed-size circular buffer using atomic operations
 * for thread-safe access without locks. It's optimized for high-frequency
 * write operations with occasional read operations for statistics calculation.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Key Performance Features:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Lock-free:</strong> Uses only atomic operations for thread safety</li>
 *   <li><strong>Power-of-2 sizing:</strong> Enables efficient bit masking instead of modulo</li>
 *   <li><strong>Pre-allocated arrays:</strong> Zero garbage collection during recording</li>
 *   <li><strong>Atomic counters:</strong> Thread-safe write position and sample count tracking</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage Pattern:</strong>
 * This ring buffer is designed for high-frequency writes from multiple threads
 * with occasional reads for statistics. Write operations are optimized for speed,
 * while read operations provide eventually consistent snapshots.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Capacity:</strong>
 * The actual capacity will be rounded up to the next power of 2 for performance
 * optimization. For example, requesting capacity 100 will result in actual capacity 128.
