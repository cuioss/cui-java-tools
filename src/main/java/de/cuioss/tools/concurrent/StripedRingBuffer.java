/**
 * High-performance striped ring buffer implementation for concurrent measurements.
 * <p>
 * Uses multiple independent ring buffers (stripes) to minimize contention
 * between threads. Each thread writes to a different stripe based on its
 * hash code, significantly reducing lock contention in high-concurrency scenarios.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Key Performance Features:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Lock-free operations:</strong> Uses atomic integers only</li>
 *   <li><strong>Stripe distribution:</strong> Multiple independent buffers reduce contention</li>
 *   <li><strong>Thread affinity:</strong> Thread-local stripe selection for cache efficiency</li>
 *   <li><strong>Power-of-2 sizing:</strong> Efficient bit masking in underlying ring buffers</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Design Pattern:</strong>
 * This follows the striping pattern commonly used in high-performance concurrent
 * data structures. By distributing operations across multiple independent buffers,
 * we achieve better scalability than single-buffer solutions while maintaining
 * the statistical accuracy needed for performance monitoring.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong>
 * All operations are thread-safe and lock-free. Multiple threads can simultaneously
 * record measurements and read statistics without blocking each other.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Time Units:</strong>
 * The striped ring buffer now supports configurable time units. By default, values are
 * interpreted as microseconds for backward compatibility.
