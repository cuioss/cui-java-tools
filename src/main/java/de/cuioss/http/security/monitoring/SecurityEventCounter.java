/**
 * Thread-safe counter for tracking security events by failure type.
 *
 * <p>This class provides a centralized mechanism for counting security violations,
 * enabling monitoring, alerting, and security analytics. It uses atomic operations
 * and concurrent collections to ensure thread safety without locks.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Design Principles</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Thread Safety</strong> - All operations are atomic and thread-safe</li>
 *   <li><strong>Lock-Free</strong> - Uses lock-free data structures for performance</li>
 *   <li><strong>Memory Efficient</strong> - Only allocates counters for observed failure types</li>
 *   <li><strong>Non-Blocking</strong> - All operations complete in constant time</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * <pre>
 * // Create event counter
 * SecurityEventCounter counter = new SecurityEventCounter();
 *
 * // Increment counters for different failure types
 * long pathTraversalCount = counter.increment(UrlSecurityFailureType.PATH_TRAVERSAL_DETECTED);
 * long encodingCount = counter.increment(UrlSecurityFailureType.DOUBLE_ENCODING);
 *
 * // Query current counts
 * long currentCount = counter.getCount(UrlSecurityFailureType.PATH_TRAVERSAL_DETECTED);
 *
 * // Get all counts for reporting
 * Map&lt;UrlSecurityFailureType, Long&gt; allCounts = counter.getAllCounts();
 *
 * // Reset all counters
 * counter.reset();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Concurrent Access</h3>
 * <p>This class is designed for high-concurrency environments where multiple threads
 * may be simultaneously incrementing counters for different or the same failure types.
 * All operations are atomic and consistent.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Memory Characteristics</h3>
 * <p>Counters are created lazily - only failure types that have been observed will
 * consume memory. This makes the class efficient even when dealing with the full
 * range of possible {@link UrlSecurityFailureType} values.</p>
 *
 * Implements: Task S1 from HTTP verification specification
 *
 * @since 2.5
 * @see UrlSecurityFailureType
