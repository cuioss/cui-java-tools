/**
 * Database of IPv6 address attack patterns with comprehensive network protocol security coverage.
 * 
 * <p><strong>CRITICAL IPv6 SECURITY DATABASE:</strong> This database contains IPv6-specific
 * attack patterns that exploit network protocol vulnerabilities, parser weaknesses, and 
 * IPv6 addressing mechanisms for security bypass attempts.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These attacks exploit the complexity of IPv6 address parsing, network access controls
 * that may not properly handle IPv6 formats, and implementation inconsistencies between
 * IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks in security systems.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>IPv6 Attack Categories</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>IPv4-Mapped Bypasses</strong> - Network access control bypass via IPv6 to IPv4 mapping</li>
 *   <li><strong>Address Parser Confusion</strong> - Exploits IPv6 parsing inconsistencies between libraries</li>
 *   <li><strong>Zone Identifier Injection</strong> - Local network access via scope ID manipulation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Protocol Stack Confusion</strong> - Dual-stack implementation exploitation</li>
 *   <li><strong>URL Encoding Bypasses</strong> - IPv6 bracket handling vulnerabilities</li>
 *   <li><strong>Compression Abuse</strong> - Invalid :: (double colon) usage exploitation</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Network Security Standards</h3>
