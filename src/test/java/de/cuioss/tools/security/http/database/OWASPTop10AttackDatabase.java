/**
 * Database of OWASP Top 10 attack patterns with comprehensive vulnerability coverage.
 * 
 * <p><strong>CRITICAL OWASP TOP 10 SECURITY DATABASE:</strong> This database contains proven attack vectors
 * from the OWASP Top 10 2021 list, representing the most critical web application security risks.
 * Each pattern has been validated to bypass specific security filters and represents actual 
 * vulnerability exploitation techniques found in real-world applications.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These patterns cover advanced encoding techniques, path traversal variants, injection attacks,
 * and authentication bypasses that are commonly used by attackers and security researchers
 * to test web application security controls.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>OWASP Top 10 2021 Coverage (HTTP/URL Layer Scope)</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>A01: Broken Access Control</strong> - Path traversal with various encoding techniques</li>
 *   <li><strong>A06: Vulnerable Components</strong> - Framework-specific traversal attacks</li>
 *   <li><strong>A07: Authentication Failures</strong> - Directory traversal authentication bypasses</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Architectural Note:</strong> Application-layer attacks (SQL injection, XSS, Command injection, SSRF) 
 * are intentionally excluded as they should be handled by application security validation, not HTTP/URL 
 * security validation. This maintains proper separation of concerns between HTTP protocol security 
 * and application logic security.</p>
