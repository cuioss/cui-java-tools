/**
 * Database of Unicode homograph attack patterns with comprehensive character substitution coverage.
 * 
 * <p><strong>CRITICAL UNICODE HOMOGRAPH DATABASE:</strong> This database contains Unicode
 * homograph attack patterns that exploit visual character similarity across different
 * writing systems. Each pattern uses exact Unicode character pairs that are visually
 * identical or nearly identical to humans but have different code points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These attacks exploit the visual confusion between characters from different Unicode
 * scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Mathematical, etc.) to bypass security filters that
 * rely on exact string matching while appearing legitimate to human users.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Homograph Categories</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Cyrillic Homographs</strong> - –∞, –æ, —Ä, —Å, –µ, —Ö ‚Üí a, o, p, c, e, x</li>
 *   <li><strong>Greek Homographs</strong> - Œ±, Œø, œÅ, œÖ ‚Üí a, o, p, u</li>
 *   <li><strong>Mathematical Script</strong> - ùêö, ùê®, ùê© ‚Üí a, o, p (Unicode Mathematical Bold)</li>
 *   <li><strong>Fullwidth Characters</strong> - ÔΩÅ, ÔΩè, ÔΩê ‚Üí a, o, p (East Asian typography)</li>
 *   <li><strong>Armenian Homographs</strong> - ÷Ö, ÷É, ’∏ ‚Üí o, p, n</li>
 *   <li><strong>Georgian Homographs</strong> - ·Éù, ·Éí, ·Éû ‚Üí o, g, p</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Security Standards</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Unicode Technical Standard #39</strong> - Unicode Security Mechanisms</li>
 *   <li><strong>RFC 3490</strong> - Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-20</strong> - Improper Input Validation via homograph bypass</li>
 *   <li><strong>CWE-178</strong> - Case sensitivity bypass through character substitution</li>
