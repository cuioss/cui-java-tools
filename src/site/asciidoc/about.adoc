= About cui-java-tools

== Overview

cui-java-tools is a utility library providing essential Java tools with zero dependencies.

== Architecture

=== Core Principles

* Zero Dependencies
* Type-safe Operations
* Extensive Testing
* Comprehensive Documentation

=== Key Components

==== Property Access

* Type-safe property access through `PropertyHolder`
* Jakarta Bean Specification support
* Reflection utilities with proper access control

==== Collections

* Enhanced collection utilities
* Builder pattern support
* Thread-safe implementations

==== Logging

* Structured logging support
* Performance optimized
* Integration with standard logging frameworks

=== Technical Requirements

* Java 17 or higher

== History

First: We love guava and enjoy working with it.
While doing so we learned a lot about java and software-engineering.
But over the time
it became too big and the messy library split up, just saying
"listenablefuture-9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava.jar" gave us
the push to move on.
We started to find or create something more
suitable for our needs.
Our first approach was to create a stripped
version of guava removing all stuff we do not need.
Not being happy with
the result we created our own called library "cui-java-tools".

=== Open Source Foundation

The library builds upon ideas and code from several great open-source projects:

* https://github.com/google/guava[Google Guava]
* https://github.com/apache/commons-codec[Apache Commons Codec]
* https://github.com/apache/commons-io[Apache Commons IO]
* https://github.com/apache/commons-lang[Apache Commons Lang]
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.8.RELEASE/spring-core/[Spring-Core]

== Design Goals

=== Technical Ascpects

* Zero Dependencies
* Extensive Tests and Documentation
* High Code Quality (Sonar Compliance)
* Standard Java Integration

=== Comparison to Guava

* Focused vs. Comprehensive: cui-java-tools provides essential utilities while Guava offers extensive functionality
* Integration vs. Implementation: cui-java-tools acts as a facade/decorator on standard Java elements
* Size: cui-java-tools is about 15 times smaller than Guava
* Performance: Focuses on maintainable performance rather than micro-optimizations

== Documentation

=== JavaDoc

All public APIs are thoroughly documented following Jakarta standards:

* Clear method descriptions
* Proper parameter documentation
* Exception documentation
* Since tags for version tracking
* Code examples where appropriate

=== Usage Examples

[source,java]
----
// Property access example
PropertyHolder holder = PropertyHolder.from(MyBean.class, "propertyName")
    .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Property not found"));
Object value = holder.readFrom(beanInstance);
